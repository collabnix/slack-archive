Archiving Slack conversations for Collabnix Community

## Story

On a fine day early this week, [`@dostiharise`](https://github.com/dostiharise) logged into Collabnix's `#golang` Slack channel to discuss thoughts on upcoming `go 1.16` release and experimental `darwin/arm64` support for Apple Silicon M1 chip.

And here we are!

## Overview

Collabnix community uses a free version of Slack to communicate which has a limit of 10,000 slack messages, beyond which we start losing old conversations. We hit this limit of 10,000 messages a long time ago, and because of this, valuable conversations were lost. Since we are growing fast this problem will only amplify over time.

Our intention behind this project is to preserve these conversations in a long-term archive, as they can prove to be valuable for its members and the rest of the developer community at large.

## Design (Draft)

To acquire the Slack messages and archive them we will need the following steps:

0. Slack Authentication (User/Bot)
1. Slack Message Ingestion (Batch/Stream)
2. Slack Message Encoder (JSON/Markdown/AsciiDoc)
3. Slack Message Storage (S3/GS/PostgreSQL/RocksDB)

To make the archive useful we may need to add some search and discovery on top of the storage layer.

4. Slack Message Indexing (DynamoDB/DataStore/BigTable/Athena/ElasticSearch/Loki)
5. Slack Message Querying (ReactJS/Kibana/Grafana/cURL)

> An interesting idea from [@ajeetraina](https://github.com/ajeetraina) (Ajeet Singh Raina) was to use Github as our storage layer so that we get the Search (Indexing and Querying) for free. üòã

## Stack 

I am proposing the following technologies to begin with. Suggestions are welcome.

Web Client:

- HTML5, CSS3
- JavaScript
- ReactJS

Web Server:

- go
- gorilla/mux

Cloud Services:

- Slack
- AWS S3
- AWS CloudWatch Events (Batch Mode)
- AWS Lambda (Batch Mode)
- AWS ECS/EKS (Stream Mode)

## Privacy

We will need to take extra care before we store any Slack messages in the public domain. We plan on starting with the job board channels (`#jobs` and `#devops-job-seeker`) from our [Collabnix's Slack](collabnix.slack.com) since the messages posted on these channels are expected to be public.
